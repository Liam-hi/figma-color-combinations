## :recycle: Introduction

Color Combinations doesn't involve the manual process of selecting colors by hand. Instead, the tool generates all the colors using a pre-defined set of rules. As you scroll with your mouse, the tool dynamically generates a variety of different color combinations.
If you're looking to experiment with various color combinations for your design, Color Combinations is the ideal tool as it allows you to effortlessly try out different color schemes with ease.
